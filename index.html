      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      
      <p>
        I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the European University Institute (EUI). My supervisors are 
        <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/coopereconomics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russell Cooper</a> 
        and 
        <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/giacomo-calzolari" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giacomo Calzolari</a>. 
      </p>
      
      <p>
        My research agenda encompasses two primary areas:
      </p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>The Interplay Between Competition and Labour Markets</strong>, which explores wage bargaining and competition, and the impact of labour market institutions on firm dynamics in imperfectly competitive markets.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Industrial Policy</strong>, focusing on the effects of state aid on firm performance and worker outcomes, as well as the interplay between industrial policies, labour market frictions, and institutional frameworks.
        </li>
      </ol>
